# Azure DevOps Integration Guide

owlctl integrates with Azure DevOps Pipelines to provide automated configuration assurance for Veeam Backup & Replication environments. This guide covers what works today, what the complete integration looks like, and what features are needed to get there.

## Quick Start: Pipeline Templates

Ready-to-use pipeline templates are available in [`examples/pipelines/`](../examples/pipelines/):

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [detect-remediate.yml](../examples/pipelines/detect-remediate.yml) | Scheduled drift detection and auto-remediation |
| [pr-validation.yml](../examples/pipelines/pr-validation.yml) | PR validation gate with dry-run |
| [deployment.yml](../examples/pipelines/deployment.yml) | Multi-stage deployment with approval gates |
| [nightly-compliance.yml](../examples/pipelines/nightly-compliance.yml) | Compliance report generation |

See the [pipeline README](../examples/pipelines/README.md) for setup instructions.

## Current Integration (v0.12.1)

### What Works Today

owlctl is already usable in Azure DevOps Pipelines with these capabilities:

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| CLI invocation in pipeline steps | Ready | Standard `script` or `Bash@3` tasks |
| Exit codes for pipeline gates | Ready | `0`=clean, `3`=warning drift, `4`=critical drift, `1`=error |
| Environment variable auth | Ready | `OWLCTL_USERNAME`, `OWLCTL_PASSWORD`, `OWLCTL_URL` |
| Severity filtering | Ready | `--severity critical`, `--security-only` flags |
| Scheduled drift scans | Ready | Pipelines support cron schedules with `always: true` |
| State file in Git | Ready | `state.json` can be committed and tracked |
| Human-readable output | Ready | Text output in pipeline logs |
| Declarative job management | Ready | `job export` → `job apply` → `job diff` for backup jobs |
| Declarative management (all resources) | Ready | `export` → `apply` → `diff` for repos, SOBRs, encryption, KMS (see [pipeline templates](../examples/pipelines/)) |
| JSON output for diff commands | Not yet | Diff commands only output text |
| Markdown report generation | Not yet | No `--format markdown` flag |
| Webhook notifications | Not yet | Must use pipeline scripts for notifications |
| SARIF/JUnit output | Not yet | No standard security format output |

### Basic Pipeline: Scheduled Drift Scan

This is the simplest integration — a scheduled pipeline that runs drift checks and fails on critical findings.

```yaml
# azure-pipelines-drift-scan.yml
trigger: none

schedules:
  - cron: "0 6 * * 1-5"
    displayName: "Weekday 6AM UTC drift scan"
    branches:
      include:
        - master
    always: true  # Run even with no code changes

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  - group: 'veeam-credentials'  # Contains OWLCTL_USERNAME, OWLCTL_PASSWORD, OWLCTL_URL

steps:
  - script: |
      curl -L https://github.com/shapedthought/owlctl/releases/download/v0.12.1-beta1/owlctl-linux-amd64 -o owlctl
      chmod +x owlctl
    displayName: 'Install owlctl'

  - script: ./owlctl init && ./owlctl profile --set vbr && ./owlctl login
    displayName: 'Authenticate to VBR'
    env:
      OWLCTL_USERNAME: $(OWLCTL_USERNAME)
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
      OWLCTL_URL: $(OWLCTL_URL)

  - script: |
      ./owlctl job diff --all --security-only
      JOB_EXIT=$?

      ./owlctl repo diff --all --security-only
      REPO_EXIT=$?

      ./owlctl repo sobr-diff --all --security-only
      SOBR_EXIT=$?

      ./owlctl encryption diff --all --security-only
      ENC_EXIT=$?

      ./owlctl encryption kms-diff --all --security-only
      KMS_EXIT=$?

      # Fail pipeline if any CRITICAL drift found (exit code 4)
      for CODE in $JOB_EXIT $REPO_EXIT $SOBR_EXIT $ENC_EXIT $KMS_EXIT; do
        if [ $CODE -eq 4 ]; then
          echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]CRITICAL security drift detected"
          exit 1
        fi
      done

      # Warn if any non-critical drift found (exit code 3)
      for CODE in $JOB_EXIT $REPO_EXIT $SOBR_EXIT $ENC_EXIT $KMS_EXIT; do
        if [ $CODE -eq 3 ]; then
          echo "##vso[task.logissue type=warning]Security drift detected (non-critical)"
          echo "##vso[task.complete result=SucceededWithIssues;]Drift detected"
          exit 0
        fi
      done

      echo "No security drift detected"
    displayName: 'Run drift detection'
    env:
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
```

### Credentials Management

Azure DevOps provides several options for storing VBR credentials securely:

**Variable Groups (recommended for most teams)**

1. Go to Pipelines > Library > Variable groups
2. Create a group called `veeam-credentials`
3. Add variables: `OWLCTL_USERNAME`, `OWLCTL_PASSWORD` (mark as secret), `OWLCTL_URL`
4. Reference in pipeline with `- group: 'veeam-credentials'`

**Azure Key Vault (recommended for enterprise)**

1. Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
2. Link a Variable Group to the Key Vault under Pipelines > Library
3. Secrets are fetched at pipeline runtime with full audit logging

```yaml
variables:
  - group: 'owlctl-keyvault-linked'  # Linked to Azure Key Vault
```

**Secure Files (for settings.json and profiles.json)**

```yaml
steps:
  - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
    name: owlctlSettings
    inputs:
      secureFile: 'owlctl-settings.json'

  - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
    name: owlctlProfiles
    inputs:
      secureFile: 'owlctl-profiles.json'

  - script: |
      mkdir -p $HOME/.owlctl
      cp $(owlctlSettings.secureFilePath) $HOME/.owlctl/settings.json
      cp $(owlctlProfiles.secureFilePath) $HOME/.owlctl/profiles.json
      ./owlctl profile --set vbr
      ./owlctl login
    env:
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
```

### Exit Codes and Pipeline Logic

owlctl's exit codes map directly to Azure DevOps pipeline outcomes:

| owlctl Exit Code | Pipeline Result | Action |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| `0` | Succeeded | No drift — pipeline passes |
| `3` | SucceededWithIssues | INFO/WARNING drift — pipeline passes with warning |
| `4` | Failed | CRITICAL drift — pipeline fails, blocks deployment |
| `1` | Failed | Error — pipeline fails, needs investigation |

Use Azure DevOps logging commands to control how results appear:

```bash
# Mark step as succeeded with issues (yellow warning)
echo "##vso[task.complete result=SucceededWithIssues;]Non-critical drift found"

# Log a warning that appears in the pipeline summary
echo "##vso[task.logissue type=warning]3 WARNING-level drifts detected"

# Log an error
echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]CRITICAL: Encryption disabled on production job"

# Tag the build for filtering
echo "##vso[build.addbuildtag]drift-detected"
echo "##vso[build.addbuildtag]critical-drift"
```

### Multi-Stage Pipeline: Scan, Report, Notify

```yaml
# azure-pipelines-drift-full.yml
trigger: none

schedules:
  - cron: "0 6 * * *"
    displayName: "Daily 6AM UTC"
    branches:
      include:
        - master
    always: true

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

  - stage: Scan
    displayName: 'Drift Detection'
    jobs:

              chmod +x owlctl
              ./owlctl init && ./owlctl profile --set vbr && ./owlctl login
            displayName: 'Setup owlctl'
            env:
              OWLCTL_USERNAME: $(OWLCTL_USERNAME)
              OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
              OWLCTL_URL: $(OWLCTL_URL)

          - script: |
              CRITICAL=0
              OUTPUT=""

              for CMD in \
                "job diff --all" \
                "repo diff --all" \
                "repo sobr-diff --all" \
                "encryption diff --all" \
                "encryption kms-diff --all"
              do
                RESULT=$(./owlctl $CMD 2>&1) || true
                EXIT=$?
                OUTPUT="$OUTPUT\n--- owlctl $CMD ---\n$RESULT\n"
                if [ $EXIT -eq 4 ]; then
                  CRITICAL=1
                fi
              done

              echo -e "$OUTPUT" > $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/drift-report.txt
              echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=hasCritical;isOutput=true]$CRITICAL"

              if [ $CRITICAL -eq 1 ]; then
                echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]CRITICAL drift detected"
                echo "##vso[build.addbuildtag]critical-drift"
                exit 1

            env:
              OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)

          - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
            artifact: DriftReport
            condition: always()
            displayName: 'Publish drift report'

  - stage: Notify
    displayName: 'Notifications'
    dependsOn: Scan
    condition: failed()
    jobs:
      - job: NotifyTeam
        steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: DriftReport

          - script: |
              curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
                --data '{
                  "text": "CRITICAL: VBR security drift detected. Pipeline: $(Build.DefinitionName) Build: $(Build.BuildNumber). Investigate immediately."
                }' \
                $(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL)
            displayName: 'Send Slack alert'
            env:
              SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: $(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL)
```

### PR Validation: Config File Changes

If VBR configuration files (YAML job definitions, severity config) are stored in Git, a PR validation pipeline can verify changes before merge:

```yaml
# azure-pipelines-pr-validation.yml
trigger: none

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - master
  paths:
    include:
      - infrastructure/**
      - overlays/**

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  - group: 'veeam-credentials'

steps:
  - script: |
      curl -sL https://github.com/shapedthought/owlctl/releases/download/v0.12.1-beta1/owlctl-linux-amd64 -o owlctl
      chmod +x owlctl
      ./owlctl init && ./owlctl profile --set vbr && ./owlctl login
    displayName: 'Setup owlctl'
    env:
      OWLCTL_USERNAME: $(OWLCTL_USERNAME)
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
      OWLCTL_URL: $(OWLCTL_URL)

  - script: |
      # Validate all changed YAML files
      for file in $(git diff --name-only origin/master...HEAD -- '*.yaml' '*.yml'); do
        echo "Validating: $file"
        ./owlctl job plan "$file" --show-yaml
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]Validation failed for $file"
          exit 1
        fi
      done
    displayName: 'Validate job configurations'
    env:
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
```

Set this as a **required build validation** under Repos > Branches > Branch Policies for `master` to block PRs that contain invalid configurations.

### Self-Hosted Agents

For environments where the VBR server is not internet-accessible, use a self-hosted agent on the same network:

```yaml
pool:
  name: 'VeeamInfraPool'  # Self-hosted agent pool
  demands:
    - Agent.OS -equals Linux
```

Self-hosted agents are installed on a machine within your network. This avoids exposing the VBR API to the internet. The agent communicates outbound to Azure DevOps (no inbound ports required).

## Complete Integration

Epic #42 is now complete, enabling full declarative management with automated remediation across all VBR resource types:

- **Epic #23** — Configuration Assurance (detection and alerting for all VBR resource types) ✅ Complete
- **Epic #42** — Declarative Resource Management and Remediation (export, snapshot, apply for all resource types) ✅ Complete

### Declarative Management Workflow

Every VBR resource type now supports the full lifecycle:

```
export → snapshot → apply → diff
```

**Day 1: Establish baseline**
```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      # Export current VBR configuration to YAML specs
      ./owlctl repo export --all -o infrastructure/repos/
      ./owlctl repo sobr-export --all -o infrastructure/sobrs/
      ./owlctl encryption export --all -o infrastructure/encryption/
      ./owlctl encryption kms-export --all -o infrastructure/kms/

      # Snapshot resources as desired state (no VBR changes)
      ./owlctl repo snapshot --all
      ./owlctl repo sobr-snapshot --all
      ./owlctl encryption snapshot --all
      ./owlctl encryption kms-snapshot --all
    displayName: 'Bootstrap declarative management'
```

The specs are committed to Git. State records each resource with `origin: "applied"`, meaning owlctl knows what the configuration *should* look like and can remediate drift.

### Automated Detect and Remediate

The key pipeline enabled by Epic #42. Detects drift, auto-remediates what VBR allows, and reports what it can't fix.

```yaml
# azure-pipelines-remediate.yml
trigger: none

schedules:
  - cron: "0 6 * * 1-5"
    displayName: "Weekday 6AM UTC"
    branches:
      include:
        - master
    always: true

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  - group: 'veeam-credentials'

stages:
  - stage: Detect
    displayName: 'Detect Drift'
    jobs:
      - job: DriftScan

                ./owlctl $CMD 2>&1 || true
                if [ $? -eq 4 ]; then CRITICAL=1; fi
              done

```

### Apply Exit Codes

With Epic #42, apply commands return additional exit codes that pipelines can use:

| Exit Code | Command | Meaning | Pipeline Action |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `0` | diff | No drift | Pass |
| `0` | apply | All fields accepted by VBR | Pass |
| `3` | diff | INFO/WARNING drift | SucceededWithIssues |
| `4` | diff | CRITICAL drift | Fail — trigger remediation |
| `5` | apply | Partial — some fields accepted, some rejected by VBR | SucceededWithIssues — notify team |
| `6` | apply | Resource destroyed — deleted from VBR | Fail — manual recreation needed |
| `1` | any | Error | Fail — investigate |

### API-First Remediation

owlctl follows the Kubernetes/Terraform model for remediation: **send all changes to VBR and let the API decide what's mutable**. Apply sends the desired state from the Git-tracked YAML spec, and VBR accepts or rejects each field. owlctl reports the outcome:

```
Applying: Default Backup Repository
  Applied: maxTaskCount: 1 -> 4
  Applied: description: "old" -> "updated"
  Rejected by VBR: type: WinLocal -> LinuxHardened
    (field is immutable after creation)

2 fields applied, 1 field rejected.
```

This avoids maintaining field-level mutability maps that must stay in sync across VBR versions. The API is the authority on what can be changed. An optional `remediation-config.yaml` can pre-filter fields to suppress known failures, but it's not required.

### Full Resource Coverage

With Epic #23 Phases 2-4 complete, drift scans and remediation cover the entire VBR security surface:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      # Current
      ./owlctl job diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl repo diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl repo sobr-diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl encryption diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl encryption kms-diff --all --security-only

      # Epic #23 Phase 2 (planned — #29, #30, #31, #32)
      ./owlctl rbac diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl infra servers diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl credentials diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl traffic diff --all --security-only

      # Epic #23 Phase 3 (planned — #33, #34, #35)
      ./owlctl malware diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl config-backup diff --all --security-only
      ./owlctl notifications diff --all --security-only
    displayName: 'Full security scan'
```

### Deployment Gate with Remediation

A multi-stage pipeline that validates before deploying, applies changes, and verifies afterward:

```yaml
stages:
  - stage: PreDeployCheck
    displayName: 'Pre-Deploy Compliance Check'
    jobs:
      - job: DriftGate
        steps:
          - template: templates/drift-scan.yml
            parameters:
              severity: 'critical'
              failOnDrift: true

  - stage: Deploy
    displayName: 'Deploy Configuration'

    jobs:

        steps:

            parameters:
              severity: 'warning'
              failOnDrift: false
```

### JSON Output for Machine Consumption

**Planned feature:** `--output json` flag on all diff commands

With JSON output, pipelines can parse results programmatically:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      ./owlctl job diff --all --output json > job-drift.json
      ./owlctl repo diff --all --output json > repo-drift.json

      # Parse with jq for conditional logic
      CRITICAL_COUNT=$(jq '[.drifts[] | select(.severity == "CRITICAL")] | length' job-drift.json)
      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=criticalCount]$CRITICAL_COUNT"
    displayName: 'Structured drift scan'
```

### Markdown Reports Attached to Build Summary

**Required feature:** `--output markdown` flag or `owlctl report` command (#38)

Azure DevOps can render Markdown reports directly in the build summary tab:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      ./owlctl report --format markdown > $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drift-summary.md
      echo "##vso[task.uploadsummary]$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drift-summary.md"
    displayName: 'Generate compliance report'
```

### Multi-Resource Correlation

**Required feature:** Correlation engine (#36)

```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      ./owlctl correlate --all --output json > correlation.json
      PATTERNS=$(jq '.patterns | length' correlation.json)
      if [ $PATTERNS -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]$PATTERNS coordinated change patterns detected"
        echo "##vso[build.addbuildtag]correlated-drift"
        exit 1
      fi
    displayName: 'Check for coordinated changes'
```

### Dashboard Integration

Azure DevOps dashboards can display drift trends using several approaches:

**Build History Widget** — Shows pass/fail trend for the drift scan pipeline. A failing build = drift detected.

**Test Results Trend** — If owlctl outputs JUnit XML format in a future release, the Test Results Trend widget would show drift counts over time.

**Wiki Auto-Update** — Pipeline publishes the latest report to an Azure DevOps wiki page:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: |
      REPORT=$(./owlctl report --format markdown)
      az devops configure --defaults \
        organization=$(System.CollectionUri) \
        project="$(System.TeamProject)"
      echo "$REPORT" | az repos wiki page update \
        --wiki "project-wiki" \
        --path "/Compliance/VBR-Drift-Report" \
        --content "$REPORT"
    displayName: 'Update wiki dashboard'
    env:
      AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT: $(System.AccessToken)
```

## Reference: Pipeline Templates

Complete, ready-to-use pipeline templates are available in [`examples/pipelines/`](../examples/pipelines/). The templates below show reusable steps that can be embedded in your own pipelines.

### Template: Reusable Drift Scan Step

Create a template that can be included in any pipeline:

```yaml
# templates/drift-scan.yml
parameters:
  - name: severity
    type: string
    default: 'critical'
  - name: failOnDrift
    type: boolean
    default: true

steps:
  - script: |
      CRITICAL=0

      for CMD in \
        "job diff --all --severity ${{ parameters.severity }}" \
        "repo diff --all --severity ${{ parameters.severity }}" \
        "repo sobr-diff --all --severity ${{ parameters.severity }}" \
        "encryption diff --all --severity ${{ parameters.severity }}" \
        "encryption kms-diff --all --severity ${{ parameters.severity }}"
      do
        ./owlctl $CMD 2>&1 || true
        if [ $? -eq 4 ]; then
          CRITICAL=1
        fi
      done

      if [ $CRITICAL -eq 1 ] && [ "${{ parameters.failOnDrift }}" = "True" ]; then
        echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]Critical drift detected"
        exit 1
      fi
    displayName: 'owlctl drift scan'
    env:
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
```

Use in a pipeline:

```yaml
steps:
  - template: templates/drift-scan.yml
    parameters:
      severity: 'warning'
      failOnDrift: true
```

### Template: Remediate from Git Specs

A reusable step that applies all YAML specs from a directory structure:

```yaml
# templates/remediate.yml
parameters:
  - name: specsPath
    type: string
    default: 'infrastructure'

steps:
  - script: |
      PARTIAL=0
      DESTROYED=0

      # Apply job specs
      for spec in ${{ parameters.specsPath }}/jobs/*.yaml; do
        [ -f "$spec" ] || continue
        ./owlctl job apply "$spec"
        EXIT=$?
        if [ $EXIT -eq 5 ]; then PARTIAL=1; fi
        if [ $EXIT -eq 6 ]; then DESTROYED=1; fi
      done

      # Apply repo specs
      for spec in ${{ parameters.specsPath }}/repos/*.yaml; do
        [ -f "$spec" ] || continue
        ./owlctl repo apply "$spec"
        EXIT=$?
        if [ $EXIT -eq 5 ]; then PARTIAL=1; fi
        if [ $EXIT -eq 6 ]; then DESTROYED=1; fi
      done

      # Apply SOBR specs
      for spec in ${{ parameters.specsPath }}/sobrs/*.yaml; do
        [ -f "$spec" ] || continue
        ./owlctl repo sobr-apply "$spec"
        EXIT=$?
        if [ $EXIT -eq 5 ]; then PARTIAL=1; fi
        if [ $EXIT -eq 6 ]; then DESTROYED=1; fi
      done

      if [ $DESTROYED -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "##vso[task.logissue type=error]One or more resources deleted from VBR — manual recreation required"
        exit 1
      fi

      if [ $PARTIAL -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "##vso[task.logissue type=warning]Partial remediation — some fields rejected by VBR API"
        echo "##vso[task.complete result=SucceededWithIssues;]Partial remediation"
      fi
    displayName: 'Apply desired state from Git'
    env:
      OWLCTL_PASSWORD: $(OWLCTL_PASSWORD)
```

  - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
    artifact: ComplianceReport
    displayName: 'Publish report'
    condition: always()

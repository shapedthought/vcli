**Formatting provided by [Nushell.](https://www.nushell.sh/)** owlctl only gets the data!

See the [User guide](https://github.com/shapedthought/owlctl/blob/master/user_guide.md) for more information.

NOTE:

- This is not an official Veeam tool and is provided under the MIT license.
- This tool is still in development so there maybe breaking changes in the future.

## What is owlctl?

A cross-platform CLI tool for managing Veeam infrastructure through APIs. Works with VBR, Enterprise Manager, VB365, VONE, and VB for AWS/Azure/GCP.

**Two modes:**
- **Imperative** - Direct API operations (GET/POST/PUT) for all Veeam products
- **Declarative** - Infrastructure-as-code with drift detection for VBR (jobs, repositories, SOBRs, encryption, KMS)

## Why owlctl?

- **Simple setup** - Single binary, no dependencies, works anywhere
- **Handles authentication** - OAuth, Basic Auth, session management built-in
- **GitOps ready** - Export configs to YAML, track in Git, detect drift, auto-remediate
- **Multi-environment** - Configuration overlays for dev/staging/prod
- **Security-focused** - Drift detection with CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO severity classification

Perfect for automating Veeam products without native CLIs (AWS/Azure/GCP) or adding GitOps workflows to VBR.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Download the binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/shapedthought/owlctl/releases) and verify the checksum:

```bash
# Windows
Get-FileHash -Path owlctl.exe -Algorithm SHA256

# macOS/Linux
shasum -a 256 owlctl  # or: sha256sum owlctl
```

### 2. Initialize and Login

```bash
# Create config files
./owlctl init

# Set credentials
export OWLCTL_USERNAME="administrator"
export OWLCTL_PASSWORD="your-password"
export OWLCTL_URL="vbr.example.com"

# Set profile (select Veeam product)
./owlctl profile --set vbr

# Authenticate
./owlctl login
```

### 3. Choose Your Workflow

**Imperative Mode** (quick API operations):
```bash
./owlctl get jobs
./owlctl post jobs/<id>/start
```

**Declarative Mode** (infrastructure-as-code for VBR):
```bash
# Register your VBR server (creates owlctl.yaml)
./owlctl instance add vbr-prod --url vbr-prod.example.com --product vbr
./owlctl instance set vbr-prod

# Export existing configuration to YAML
./owlctl job export <job-id> -o my-job.yaml

# Apply configuration (also saves state for drift detection)
./owlctl job apply my-job.yaml --dry-run
./owlctl job apply my-job.yaml

# Snapshot resources that aren't managed by apply yet
./owlctl repo snapshot --all

# Detect drift against saved state
./owlctl job diff --all --security-only
```

> **State and compliance:** `state.json` is operational — it enables drift detection but is not an audit log. For compliance, rely on Git commit history, CI/CD run logs, and VBR's own audit trail. This is the same model as Terraform.

## Installing 🛠️

<b>IMPORTANT The only trusted source of this tool is directly from the release page, or building from source.</b>

<b>Please also check the checksum of the downloaded file before running.</b>

owlctl runs in place without needing to be installed on a computer.

It can be added to your system's path to allow system wide access.

To download please go to the releases tab.

windows

    Get-FileHash -Path <file path> -Algorithm SHA256

Mac

    shasum -a 256 <file path>

Linux - distributions may vary

    sha256sum <file path>

## Compiling from source

If you wish to compile the tool from source, please clone this repo, install Golang, and run the following in the root directory.

Windows:

    go build -o owlctl.exe

Mac/ Linux

    go build -o owlctl

## Docker 🐋

NOTE: at time of writing there will be <b>no official docker image.</b>

To run owlctl in an isolated environment you can use a Docker container.

    docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash

    wget <URL of download>

    ./owlctl init

Persisting the init fils can be done with a bindmount, but note that this does open a potential security hole.

You can of course create your own docker image with owlctl installed which can be built from source.

Example using local git clone:

    FROM golang:1.18 as build

    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    COPY go.mod go.sum ./

    RUN go mod download && go mod verify

    COPY . .

    RUN go build -v -o /usr/local/bin/owlctl

    FROM ubuntu:latest

    WORKDIR /home/owlctl

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install vim -y

    COPY --from=build /usr/local/bin/owlctl ./

Then exec into the container

    docker run --rm -it YOUR_ACCOUNT/owlctl:0.2 bash

    cd /home/owlctl

    ./owlctl init

With the --rm flag the container will deleted immediately after use.

Even when downloading the owlctl into a Docker container, ensure you check the checksum!

## Why Go?

The main reason for using Go, after careful consideration, was that it compiles to a single binary with all decencies included.

Python was a close second, and is a great language, but some of the complexities of dependency management can make it more difficult to get started.

If anyone knows me I love RUST, but for this decided that Go was a better choice.

If you prefer other languages, feel free to take this implementation as an example and build your own.

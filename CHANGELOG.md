## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Epic #96: Groups, Targets & Profile/Overlay System

This release introduces group-based batch operations, named VBR targets, and profile/overlay support for standardised backup policy management across all declarative resource types.

### Added

#### Groups, Profiles & Overlays (Phase 1)
- `--group <name>` flag on `job apply` and `job diff` — batch-apply or drift-check all specs in a group
- `group list` and `group show <name>` commands for inspecting configured groups
- `kind: Profile` and `kind: Overlay` YAML types for standardisation and policy patches
- 3-way strategic merge: profile (base defaults) → spec (identity + exceptions) → overlay (policy patch)
- `groups` section in owlctl.yaml with `profile`, `overlay`, and `specs` references
- `Kind` constants and `IsMixinKind()`/`IsResourceKind()` helpers in resources package

#### Named VBR Targets (Phase 2)
- `targets` section in owlctl.yaml for named VBR server connections
- `--target <name>` persistent flag on all commands — overrides `OWLCTL_URL` for the session
- `target list` command with table and `--json` output

#### Extended Resource Group Support (Phase 3)
- `--group <name>` flag on `repo apply` / `repo diff`
- `--group <name>` flag on `repo sobr-apply` / `repo sobr-diff`
- `--group <name>` flag on `encryption kms-apply` / `encryption kms-diff`

### Changed
- Deprecated `currentEnvironment` and `environments` fields in owlctl.yaml (deprecation warning emitted when present)
- Restructured examples directory for groups/profiles/overlays model
- Updated all documentation for groups/targets/profiles model

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-07

### Rebrand: vcli is now owlctl

This release marks the rebrand from **vcli** to **owlctl** and the project's first stable release.

## [0.11.0-beta1] - 2026-02-04

### Epic #66: Modernized Authentication & Automation

This release delivers major improvements to security, automation workflows, and CI/CD integration through a **clean break** from v0.10.x configuration format.

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGES** - See [Migration Guide](docs/migration-v0.10-to-v0.11.md)

**Quick upgrade:**
```bash
owlctl init profiles  # Regenerate configs
owlctl login          # Done!
```

### Breaking Changes

#### 1. Non-Interactive Init by Default
- `owlctl init` now non-interactive by default (outputs JSON for scripting)
- Interactive mode available via `--interactive` flag
- Automation-first design for CI/CD workflows
- **Migration:** CI/CD scripts work unchanged; interactive users add `--interactive` flag

#### 2. Profile Commands Take Arguments
- Profile management commands now require arguments instead of prompting
- `owlctl profile --set vbr` (was: interactive prompt)
- JSON output by default; `--table` flag for human-readable format
- **Migration:** Add profile name as argument in scripts

#### 3. Secure Token Storage
- Tokens stored in system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- File-based fallback with encryption for systems without keychain
- Auto-authentication in CI/CD environments (non-TTY detection)
- Explicit token control via `OWLCTL_TOKEN` environment variable
- **Security:** No more plaintext tokens in `headers.json`
- **Migration:** Just `owlctl login` after upgrade

#### 4. profiles.json v1.0 Format
- Completely restructured configuration format with versioning
- All profiles in single file (easy switching)
- Logical grouping of endpoints and headers
- Proper types (port as number, not string)
- **Migration:** Regenerate with `owlctl init profiles`

#### 5. Removed CredsFileMode
- Credentials now **always** from environment variables
- No more `--creds-file` option
- Consistent with 12-factor app principles and CI/CD standards
- **Migration:** Set `OWLCTL_USERNAME`, `OWLCTL_PASSWORD`, `OWLCTL_URL` environment variables

### Added

#### Authentication Improvements
- System keychain integration for secure token storage
- Hybrid token resolution: `OWLCTL_TOKEN` → keychain → auto-auth
- CI/CD environment detection (skips keychain on headless systems)
- File-based keyring with encryption as fallback
- Password prompting for file keyring in interactive sessions
- `OWLCTL_FILE_KEY` environment variable for non-interactive file keyring

#### Configuration Management
- Versioned profiles.json format (`"version": "1.0"`)
- Multi-profile support in single configuration file
- Structured endpoint and header configuration
- `init profiles` command for profile-only initialization
- `init settings` command for settings-only initialization

#### Commands
- `owlctl init` - Non-interactive with JSON output by default
- `owlctl init --interactive` - Legacy interactive mode
- `owlctl init profiles` - Generate only profiles.json
- `owlctl init settings` - Generate only settings.json
- `owlctl profile --list --table` - Human-readable profile list
- `owlctl profile --set <name>` - Argument-based profile switching

### Changed

#### Behavior Changes
- Default init mode is now non-interactive (JSON output)
- Profile commands require arguments instead of prompting
- Tokens never stored in plaintext files
- Configuration file permissions: `0600` (owner-only)
- Authentication flows through system keychain in interactive sessions
- Auto-authentication in CI/CD without keychain interaction

#### API Version Updates
- VBR: `1.1-rev0` → `1.3-rev1`
- VB365: `v6/v7` → `v8` (consistent version)
- VB for AWS: `1.3-rev0` → `1.4-rev0`
- VB for Azure: `v4` → `v5`
- VB for GCP: `1.1-rev0` → `1.2-rev0`
- VONE: `1.0-rev1` → `1.0-rev2`

### Removed
- `--creds-file` flag and CredsFileMode support
- Plaintext token storage in headers.json
- Interactive prompts from default init behavior
- Legacy profiles.json format (pre-v1.0)

### Security
- **Critical:** Hardcoded file keyring password replaced with `OWLCTL_FILE_KEY` env var + interactive prompt
- **Critical:** Configuration file permissions changed from `0644` to `0600`
- **Critical:** Tokens stored in OS-encrypted keychain instead of plaintext files
- Tilde expansion bug fixed in file keyring path resolution
- Token validation improved (JWT detection + length checks)

### Fixed
- Tilde expansion in file keyring directory path
- Token validation logic (flawed OR condition)
- Flag description inconsistencies (`apiNotSecure` vs `skipTLSVerify`)
- VB365 API version consistency (mixed v6/v7 → v8)
- Removed deprecated `authenticate()` method
- Removed unused code and comments

### Documentation
- Complete documentation restructure and improvements
- New focused guides: Authentication, Imperative Mode, Declarative Mode, State Management, Troubleshooting
- Comprehensive examples for jobs, repositories, SOBRs, KMS servers, and overlays
- Added Getting Started guide for new users
- Created Command Reference quick lookup guide
- Transformed user_guide.md into navigable index page
- **New:** Migration guide (docs/migration-v0.10-to-v0.11.md)
- CI/CD pipeline migration guide
- Troubleshooting common upgrade issues

### Dependencies
- Updated `jose2go` from v1.5.0 to v1.7.0 (fixes Snyk vulnerabilities)

### Design Philosophy: Why Clean Break?

We chose a clean break over backward compatibility:
- **Simpler:** 2-minute config regeneration vs complex migration logic
- **Cleaner:** No legacy format support to maintain
- **Better UX:** Clear errors, single fix that always works
- **Faster delivery:** Ship improvements immediately
- **Industry standard:** Major tools (Terraform, Kubernetes) make clean breaks

### Upgrade Notes

**For all users:**
1. Backup configs (optional): `cp -r ~/.owlctl ~/.owlctl.old`
2. Regenerate: `owlctl init profiles`
3. Re-login: `owlctl login`
4. Test: `owlctl get jobs`

**For CI/CD:**
- Environment variables work unchanged
- Update profile commands to pass arguments: `owlctl profile --set vbr`
- See [Azure DevOps Integration Guide](docs/azure-devops-integration.md)
